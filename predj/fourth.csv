	In the present study, we developed silicosis of
rat model by bronchial perfusion SiO, dust, and intervenes with
AcSDKP, immunohisto chemistry was used to detect NF-κb and MCP-1 expression in lung
tissue, and positive cells were counted. We found that compared with silicotic
model group, the positive cells of NF-κb and MCP-1 were decreased significantly
in anti-fibrosis treatment of AcSDKP group. The findings suggest that AcSDKP could inhibit the expression of NF-κb
and MCP-1 in lung tissue of silicosos, this may be related to AcSDKP inhibit of
macrophage infiltration in lung tissue and reduced the degree of dust
alveolitis.

	The aim of the current preliminary research was
to examine the relationship between aquatic motor activities and language abilities.
Our hypothesis suggests that changing the environment to water may improve motor
and linguistic abilities. The study included 94 children between the ages of four
and six. Thirty-one children who participated in aquatic motor activities were compared
to 41 children who participated in on-land motor activities and to 21 children who
participated in non-motor activities. Developmental-functionality tests, including
gross and fine motor, time estimation and language tests, were used to diagnose
participants’ abilities before and after six months of intervention. We found significant
improvement in gross motor, fine motor and time estimation abilities for the aquatic
motor activities group. Moreover, improvement in gross motor and time estimation
abilities moderated the association between aquatic motor activities and children’s
naming ability, suggesting the positive effect of aquatic motor activities on language
abilities. Based on these novel findings, child-development professionals can have
a better understanding of relation between language abilities and motor abilities,
possibly leading to an improvement of intervention methods with early-childhood
patients. Early childhood intervention could aid in reducing primary differences
between children in motor abilities, and especially in motor-development disorders,
which in turn are thought to lead to additional learning disabilities.

	Failure of induction
motors are a large concern due to its influence over industrial production.
Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is common practice in industry to find
motor faults. This paper presents a new approach to detection and diagnosis of
motor bearing faults based on induction motor stator current analysis. Tests
were performed with three bearing conditions: baseline, outer race fault and inner race fault. Because the
signals associated with faults produce small modulations to supply component
and high nose levels, a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) is used in this
paper to detect and diagnose different motor bearing defects. The results show
that bearing faults can induced a detestable amplitude increases at its
characteristic frequencies. MSB peaks show a clear difference at these
frequencies whereas conventional power spectrum provides change evidences only
at some of the frequencies. This shows that MSB has a better and reliable
performance in extract small changes from the faulty bearing for fault detection
and diagnosis. In addition, the study also show that current signals from
motors with variable frequency drive controller have too much noise and it is
unlikely to discriminate the small bearing fault component.

	Shockwave detection is critical in
analyzing shockwave structure and location. High speed video imaging systems
are commonly used to obtain image frames during shockwave control experiments.
Image edge detection algorithms become natural choices in detecting shockwaves. In this paper, a computer
software system designed for shockwave detection is introduced. Different image
edge detection algorithms, including Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel, Canny, and Laplacian of Gaussian, are implemented and
can be chosen by the users to easily and accurately detect the shockwaves. Experimental results show that the
system meets the design requirements and can accurately detect shockwave for
further analysis and applications.

objective optimization model of routes choosing, which is based on the improved
Ant Colony Algorithm. Furthermore, we make some adjustment in parameters in
order to improve the precision of this algorithm. For example, the inspired
factor has been changed to get better results. Also, the ways of searching have
been adjusted so that the traveling routes will be well designed to achieve
optimal effects. At last, we select a series of attractions in Beijing as data
to do an experimental analysis, which comes out with an optimum route arrangement
for the travelers; that is to say, the models we propose and the algorithm we
improved are reasonable and effective.

for semi-rigid changed 3D point clouds registration. We first segment the point
clouds into individual segments and then the alignment energy costs of each
segment are calculated. The rough initial transformation is estimated by

results are obtained by rigid alignments of separated corresponded segments. Experimental
result with simulated point clouds demonstrate that the concept of semi-rigid

	This paper examines safety impacts of a Pedestrian
Countdown Signal (PCS) installed on a busy downtown intersection in San Diego,
California. Crossing episodes of over 5000 pedestrians were videotaped and
analyzed using multivariate statistical methods. Details of timing of
pedestrian crossing as well as information about vehicular traffic and signal
timing were carefully coded for each pedestrian. Significant safety benefits of
the PCS system were found on the long crossings over a street with high
vehicular volumes: most pedestrians were able to effectively increase their
walking speed to complete their crossing without committing the exit
violation—even if they have already committed the entry violation. However, on
the short crossing with light vehicular traffic, PCS was generally ineffective
in preventing the entry violations from becoming exit violations. Over there,
many pedestrians felt safe enough to walk over a short crossing with no
apparent vehicular traffic in sight instead of waiting for a green signal. The
length of crossing and volume of interfering vehicular traffic were
consistently found the most significant variables affecting the crossing violation
rates of different categories of pedestrians. Crossing violation rates were the
highest for runners, bicyclists and older males. Crossing violation
characteristics were found to be consistent over time.

	Emotion mismatch between training and

speaker recognition system. In our previous work, a bi-model emotion speaker
recognition (BESR) method based on virtual HD (High Different from neutral,
with large pitch offset) speech synthesizing was proposed to deal with this
problem. It enhanced the system performance under mismatch emotion states in
MASC, while still suffering the system risk introduced by fusing the scores
from the unreliable VHD model and the neutral model with equal weight. In this
paper, we propose a new BESR method based on score reliability fusion. Two strategies,
by utilizing identification rate and scores average relative loss difference,
are presented to estimate the weights for the two group scores. The results on
both MASC and EPST shows that by using the weights generated by the two strategies,
the BESR method achieve a better performance than that by using the equal
weight, and the better one even achieves a result comparable to that by using
the best weights selected by exhaustive strategy.

	The classical TV (Total Variation)
model has been applied to gray texture image denoising and inpainting previously
based on the non local operators, but such model can not be directly used to
color texture image inpainting due to coupling of different image layers in
color images. In order to solve the inpainting problem for color texture images
effectively, we
propose a non local CTV (Color Total Variation) model. Technically, the
proposed model is an extension of local TV model for gray images but we take
account of the coupling of different layers in color images and make use of
concepts of the non-local operators. As the coupling of different layers for
color images in the proposed model will in-crease computational complexity, we also
design a fast Split Bregman algorithm. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted
to validate the performance of the proposed model and its algorithm.

	Periodical impulse component is one of
typical fault characteristics in vibration signals from rotating machinery. However,
this component is very small in the early stage of the fault and masked by
various noises such as gear meshing components modulated by shaft frequency, which
make it difficult to extract accurately for fault detection. The adaptive line
enhancer (ALE) is an effective technique for separating sinusoidals from broad-band components of an input
signal for detecting the presence of sinusoids in white noise. In this paper,
ALE is explored to suppress the periodical gear meshing frequencies and enhance
the fault feature impulses for more accurate fault diagnosis. The results
obtained from simulated and experimental vibration signals of a two stage
helical gearbox prove that the ALE method is very effective in reducing the
periodical gear meshing noise and making the impulses in vibration very clear
in the time-frequency analysis. The results show a clear difference between the
baseline and 30% tooth damage of a helical gear which has not been detected
successfully in author’s previous studies.

fingerprint image very well. To address this problem, we propose a local
orientation field based nonlocal means (NLM-LOF) method in this paper. Experimental
results on the simulated and real images show that the proposed method can
suppress noise effectively while preserving edges and details in the
fingerprint image and it outperforms the state-of-art nonlocal means method in
terms of qualitative metrics and visual comparisons.

	This paper presents a corner-based
image alignment algorithm based on the procedures of corner-based template
matching and geometric parameter estimation. This algorithm consists of two
stages: 1) training phase, and 2) matching phase. In the training phase, a
corner detection algorithm is used to extract the corners. These corners are
then used to build the pyramid images. In the matching phase, the corners are
obtained using the same corner detection algorithm. The similarity measure is
then determined by the differences of gradient vector between the corners
obtained in the template image and the inspection image, respectively. A
parabolic function is further applied to evaluate the geometric relationship between
the template and the inspection images. Results show that the corner-based
template matching outperforms the original edge-based template matching in
efficiency, and both of them are robust against non-liner light changes. The
accuracy and precision of the corner-based image alignment are competitive to
that of edge-based image alignment under the same environment. In practice, the
proposed algorithm demonstrates its precision, efficiency and robustness in
image alignment for real world applications.

	This paper
presents a fully automatic segmentation method of liver CT scans using fuzzy
c-mean clustering and level set. First, the contrast of original image is
enhanced to make boundaries clearer; second, a spatial fuzzy c-mean clustering combining ,with ,anatomical prior knowledge is employed to
extract liver region automatically; thirdly, a
distance regularized level set is used for refinement; finally, morphological
operations are used as post-processing. The experiment result shows that the method can
achieve high accuracy (0.9986) and specificity (0.9989). Comparing with standard level set method, our method is more effective in
dealing with over-segmentation problem.

	Dictionary learning has been applied
to face recognition and gets good results. However few works applied dictionary
learning in facial expression recognition. This paper investigates the
application of K-SVD in facial expression recognition. Since K-SVD focuses on
reconstruction and lacks discriminant capability. It has similar classification
performance with image pixel values. To address this problem, this paper
proposes a Combined Dictionary Scheme, which uses combination of separate dictionaries.
This yields better performance than the original single dictionary scheme in
terms of both recognition rate and computation complexity.

multiple-output (MIMO) relay technique has been received great attention due to
its prominent ability to provide broad coverage and enhance the link
reliability and spectral efficiency. In this paper, an overview of optimal
design for single user and multiuser non-regenerative MIMO relay systems is
proposed. We explore some key designs of source node and destination node as
well as relay node processing matrices using minimum mean square error (MMSE)
criterion under the transmit power constraints. Simulation results compare

	The ESMD method can be seen as a new alternate of the
well-known Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for non-steady data processing. It is
good at finding the optimal adaptive global mean fitting curve, which is
superior to the common least-square method and running-mean approach. Take the
air-sea momentum flux investigation as an example, only when the non-turbulent wind
components is well extracted, can the
remainder signal be seen as actual oscillations caused by turbulence. With the
aid of —5/3 power law for the
turbulence, a mode-filtering approach based on ESMD decomposition is developed
here. The test on observational data indicates that this approach
is very feasible and it may greatly reduce the error caused by the non-turbulent
components.

nonlinear adaptive filter for extraction of time varying sinusoids using Xilinx

filter model along with its performance makes it one of the foremost candidates
to be applied on nonlinear systems for the purpose of estimation and extraction
using reconfigurable hardware like FPGA. A design implementation and
verification approach has been discussed for more efficient implementation.
Timing and power analysis has been performed and the architecture has been
optimized for speed and power to perform at higher frequency when integrated on
a Xilinx FPGA. The proposed hardware oriented architecture has been
successfully implemented and simulated. The simulation results to track a noisy

	Visual attention mechanisms allow
humans to extract relevant and important information from raw input percepts.
Many applications in robotics and computer vision have modeled human visual
attention mechanisms using a bottom-up data centric approach. In contrast, recent studies in cognitive
science highlight advantages of a top-down approach to the attention
mechanisms, especially in applications involving goal-directed search. In this
paper, we propose a top-down approach for extracting salient objects/regions of space. The
top-down methodology first isolates different objects in an unorganized point
cloud, and compares each object for uniqueness. A measure of saliency using the
properties of geodesic distance on the object’s surface is defined. Our method
works on 3D point cloud data, and identifies salient objects of high curvature
and unique silhouette. These being the most unique features of a scene, are
robust to clutter, occlusions and view point changes. We provide the details of
the proposed method and initial experimental results.

	,In edge detection algorithms, there
is a common redundancy problem, especially when the gradient direction is close
to -135°, -45°, 45°, and 135°. Double edge effect appears on the edges around
these directions. This is caused by the discrete calculation of non-maximum
suppression. Many algorithms use edge points as feature for further task such
as line extraction, curve detection, matching and recognition. Redundancy is a
very important factor of algorithm speed and accuracy. We find that most edge
detection algorithms have redundancy of 50% in the worst case and 0% in the
best case depending on the edge direction distribution. The common redundancy
rate on natural images is approximately between 15% and 20%. Based on Canny’s
framework, we propose a restriction in the hysteresis step. Our experiment
shows that proposed restricted hysteresis reduce the redundancy successfully.

	This paper outlines procedures to analyze the
desertification processes in the semi-arid Seridó Region (NE Brazil). Using the
Geosystem theory, the detection of desertification areas was based on
environmental indices, digital image processing in multispectral analysis and
Geographic Information System (GIS).The first step was to treat
the rainfall data and NDVI satellite Modis, aiming at identifying areas which
do not present vegetation cover, even during the rainy seasons.The second
step was to work on a regional scale using Landsat ETM + images (2000-2005) and
data collected in the field, as the evaluations of exposed surfaces, that
together with MDT/SRTM-NASA and thematic maps, allowed to classify the
altitude and slope of the relief, soils type, different morphologies and
geology, and correlate them with the areas susceptible to desertification
process. The integration of the georeferenced data, related to these
indicators, allowed the identification of five different levels of
susceptibility to desertification (very high, high, moderate, low and very
low), and the geographic domain of each class. Based on the analysis of the
dynamics of the vegetation cover, we can establish that the main results refer
that there is a decrease of the biomass at the region, associated with the
dense caatinga vegetation areas, but more important, with the scrub and
degraded areas.

	Geosmin is one of the major causative compounds of
earthy-musty odor and taste (off-flavor) in drinking water (lakes) and in
farmed fish. In this study, the sorption of cyclodextrin polymers (CDPs)
towards geosmin in aqueous solution was investigated. Sorption kinetics, the
effect of solution pH and contact time on the sorption capability of α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrin polymers was discussed.
Results disclosed that the sorption of geosmin by the CDPs followed the Ho and
McKay kinetic mechanism with the liquid film diffusion as the rate-determining
step. Both β-CDP and γ-CDP exhibit high removal efficiencies
of 93.4% and 96%, respectively, within 240 minutes at 25°C and pH 7, whilst α-CDP was not effective, removing only
40% geosmin, at an initial concentration of 5 μg·L,and 5 g·L,of CDP dose. The cyclodextrin polymers can adapt to a wide range of pH from 3.0
to 11.0 for geosmin adsorption with pH 7.0 as optimum. Results indicate that
these sorbents demonstrate significant potential in reducing the concentration
of geosmin in water that presents taint problems in both drinking water and
fish.

	ECG monitoring in daily life is an important means of
treating heart disease. To make it easier for the medical to monitor the
ECG of their patients outside the hospital, we designed and developed an ECG
monitoring and alarming system based on Android smart phone. In our system, an
ECG device collects the ECG signal and transmits it to an Android phone. The
Android phone detects alarms which come from the ECG devices. When alarms
occur, Android phone will capture the ECG images and the details about the
alarms, and sends them to the cloud Alarm Server (AS). Once received,
AS push the messages to doctors’ phone, so the doctors could see the ECG images
and alarm details on their mobile phone. In our system, high resolution ECG
pictures are transmitted to doctors’ phone in a user-friendly way, which can
help doctors keep track of their patient’s condition easily.

	This paper proposes a vision-based
pedestrian detection in crowded situations based on a single camera. The main
idea behind our work is to fuse multiple cues so that the major challenges,
such as occlusion and complex background facing in the topic of crowd detection
can be successfully overcome. Based on the assumption that human heads are
visible, circle Hough transform (CHT) is applied to detect all circular regions
and each of which is considered as the head candidate of a pedestrian. After
that, the false candidates resulting from complex background are firstly
removed by using template matching algorithm. Two proposed cues called head
foreground contrast (HFC) and block color relation (BCR) are incorporated for
further verification. The rectangular region of every detected human is
determined by the geometric relationships as well as foreground mask extracted
through background subtraction process. Three videos are used to validate the
proposed approach and the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively
lowers the false positives at the expense of little detection rate.

	The main objective of this study was to
determine effect of exopolysaccharide (EPS) from bacteria on formation of milk
gel. Milk gel was made from 10%, 15% and 20% Reconstituted Skim Milk (RSM). EPS
at different concentrations (0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0% according to
our previous study) were added to RSM, heated at 60°C for 30 minute and 85°C
for 30 second and cooled to 5°C before viscosity and pH were examined using viscometer and
pH-meter. Viscosity was dependent on the concentrations of skim milk, increasing as the concentration of
RSM increased. Lower concentration of EPS, viscosity showed a slight increase, but at 0.4% EPS,
viscosity of milk gel increased rapidly and continued to increase up to 1%. Microstructure
was determined using scanning electron microscope to evaluated milk gel
formation. Interaction between milk protein and EPS was showed as network aggregate
one and another. EPS function as binding agent between one molecule of casein
and another. These results indicated
that EPS could use to increase quality of milk gel.

	The principal component
analysis (PCA) is a kind of algorithms in biometrics. It is a statistics
technical and used orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations
of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables. PCA also is a tool to reduce
multidimensional data to lower dimensions while retaining most of the
information. It covers standard deviation, covariance, and eigenvectors. This
background knowledge is meant to make the PCA section very straightforward, but
can be skipped if the concepts are already familiar.

	Accurate segmentation is an important
and challenging task in any computer vision system. It also plays a vital role
in computerized analysis of skin lesion images. This paper presents a new
segmentation method that combines the advan-tages of fuzzy C mean algorithm,
thresholding and level set method. 3-class Fuzzy C mean thresholding is applied
to initialize level set automatically and also for estimating controlling
parameters for level set evolution. Parameters for performance evaluation are
presented and segmentation results are compared with some other
state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Increased true detection rate and reduced false positive
and false negative errors confirm the effectiveness of proposed method for skin
cancer detection.

	This paper
proposes a new holographic microwave imaging array (HMIA) technique for brain
stroke detection. This approach is based on holographic microwave and aperture
synthesis imaging techniques. The system is designed for operation at a single
frequency of 2.5 GHz. A realistic three dimensional (3D) head model that
contains skin, fat, skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter, white matter
and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke area is developed using MATLAB to
demonstrate the proposed HMIA imaging algorithm.A matching solution medium is used between the
antennas and the head model. The study is conducted using HMIA computer
simulations and 3D head model with-stroke.The simulation results showed that small stroke area (5
 mmin diameter) could be successfully detected with the HMIA
approach.

	Phosphorus is one of the major nutrients that
have been identified as a limited resource that would
end up earlier than predicted at the rate of current consumption. Therefore, attempts
to recover phosphorus from waste and its subsequent use are a concern of current
researchers. Nevertheless, recovery of nutrients from wastewater is cumbersome because
nutrients such as phosphates (,) and nitrates
(,) prefer to remain
in aqueous phase rather than being adsorbed on solid matrixes. Investigation of
adsorption of available, - P from simulated brackish water, on granulated
solid waste material, prepared by crushed autoclaved aerated concrete (CAAC), and
subsequent use of the material as phosphate fertilizer would be the focus of this
research. Treatment of nutrient-rich brackish water is important because such water
is discharged in huge volume at the time of harvesting of shrimp aquaculture ponds.
Experiments conducted in simulated brackish water confirmed non-linear adsorption
association with changing distribution coefficient (K,) which attributed the maximum removal of about 98%, - P from 100 mgdm,solution at its
value of 40. The non-linear adsorption supported by both the Langumuir and the Freundlich
isotherm models simultaneously satisfied monolayer adsorption and multilayer adsorption
depicted by the regression coefficients of greater than .99 by the linearized forms
of the isotherm models. Moreover, promising phosphate uptakes characteristics are
exhibited by the adsorbent at the process of repetitive adsorption which resulted
in 12 g/kg uptake of phosphate at 81% efficiency. The adsorbent seems to be used
as a slow-released phosphorus fertilizer at the end of its life as an adsorbent.

	The objective of this study was to describe
the trend of reproductive performance of primiparous and multiparous cows that
grazed rice crop residues located in a Dry Tropical Forest of Colombia, taking
into account the rainfall pattern of the place. In this study, 89 primiparous
and 309 multiparous Cebu cattle records were analyzed. Mean, mean standard
deviation for age at first calving and open days of primipar-ous Cebu cattle were 41.05± 1.85 months and 269.7±36.25 days respectively. Confidence intervals
(95%) for both reproductive parameters were 36.8-45.3 months and 202.7-336.6 days respectively.
For multiparous Cebu cattle, the mean and mean standard deviation for open days
and calving interval were 245.6±36.8 days and 17.5±0.9 months respectively. Confidence intervals
207.1-366.9 days and 13.9-20.7 months respectively. The mean rainfall since 1999 until 2012 was1202 mmper year. The reproduc-tive trend of the primiparous cattle showed
an increasing behavior of age at first calving since 1999 until 2012, that can
possibly be explained due to the decreasing behavior of the rainfall throughout
the years, that can affect the nutritional value and offer of the grass that
can grow in the borders of the crop, such as Guinea and Star grass, and
eventually affect the body condition and weight necessary to be ready for the
first estrous. An inverse behavior of open days occurred, showing a decreased
trend along the last years of research. This fact could have happened due to
the intensive use of the enriched rice straw with urea and molasses lately. Regarding
to the reproductive trend of the multiparous cattle, there is no an evident pat-tern of it. Factors such as rainfall,
temperature, nutrition and management should have affected it. Further research
on this topic is needed.

	The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel empirical iterative algorithm for medical image reconstruction, under the short
name MRP-ISWLS (Median Root Prior Image
Space Weighted Least Squares). Further, we assess the performance of the
new algorithm by comparing it to the simultaneous version of known MRP
algorithms. All algorithms are compared in terms of cross-correlation and
CNRs (Contrast-to-Noise Ratios). As it turns out, MRP-ISWLS presents higher
CNRs than the known algorithms for objects of different size. Also MRP-ISWLS
has better noise manipulation.

	The objective of this study was to elucidate
the current status of reproductive management of Bali beef cows in south Sulawesi Province,Indonesia. This study was conducted
in Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi
Province, Indonesia. Purposive sampling was used to choose the location where
the study was taking place with
consideration that this region has potential place for Bali cows. Data
collection both primary and secondary
data was done through observation and interview to obtain both quantitative and
qualitative data. The results of
this study showed that reproductive management applied to Bali cows in this region was very low. However, knowledge of the farmers regarding
reproductive management such as estrus and its signs were much better, although the time of insemination
to the estrous cows sometimes was too late. Mating system of Bali cows in this
area were two different methods; natural mating and artificial insemination
(AI). To adopt AI technology, the farmers should follow the standard operation
of this technology. This study also showed that most of the farmers had good
knowledge about estrus synchronization;
however, they are still having difficulty to obtain or to access this
technology, especially the price of the hormones used for estrus
synchronization.

	Discharge of sludge from water works into waters will result in the
increased deterioration of water environment. Therefore, an experimental study
was conducted on the addition of conditioning agent to improve sludge
dewatering performance. The result shows that coagulation is inadaptable to the
treatment of sludge from water works and use of powdered coal ash from power
plant as conditioning agent can greatly reduce the specific resistance of
sludge and the dewatering performance can be improved. The optimal dosage of
fine powdered coal is 20g/100mL and coarse powdered coal is 30g/100mL. Powdered coal
is mixed with sludge to form filter cake, which is blended with coal in certain
proportion to make into fuel. So that incineration of sludge from water works
can be realized.

	The brain is protected from the entry of foreign substances by blood-brain barrier (BBB), but becomes a barrier while chemotherapy
is needed for the brain diseases. Ultrasound with microbubbles (MBs) has been
shown to noninvasively increase the permeability of the BBB in the normal
tissue and brain tumor. The real mechanism for disruption is still unknown.
Hemorrhage was usually found in the sonicated region of the brain. Thus,
treatment safety is the primary concern when considering clinical application
of BBB disruption induced by ultrasound in the presence of MBs. Here we
investigate the effects of ultrasound on the permeability of BBB whether the
MBs were administered. The data reveals that Evans blue (EB)
accumulation was highest in the brain after sonication with MBs. However, the
permeability of BBB also can be significantly increased by ultrasound alone.
These results demonstrated that noninvasive disruption of BBB by ultrasound
alone with no damage is possible.

	The aim of this study was to know the
application of reproductive management of buffalos in West Sulawesi Province. This study was conducted
during a period from July to August 2012
 in three different sub-districts; Mehalaan, Messawa, and Nosu.
Purposive sampling was used to choose the location where the study was taking
place with consideration that those sub-districts have different population of
buffalos ranging from highest to smallest. Data collection both primary and
secondary data was done through observation and interview to obtain both quantitative and qualitative
data. The results of this study showed that mating system of buffalos in this
area were two different methods;
natural mating without any help and natural mating with the help of the
farmers, while artificial insemination (AI) method for mating the buffalos did
not apply yet. A total of 85% farmers/respondent did mating system for the buffalos
with the help of the farmers, while the remaining 15% of the farmers did mating
system without any help. This study also showed that most of the farmers had
good knowledge about estrus (98.3%) and the remaining 1.7% farmers had poor
knowledge about estrus. Most of them were capable to identify buffalos in
estrus by observing their behavior.

	Load Frequency Control (LFC) is one of power systems
important requirements which maintain the zero steady-state errors in the
frequency changing and restoring the natural frequency to its normal position.
Many problems are subject to LFC such as suddenly large load or suddenly
disconnecting generating unit by the protection device. In this paper,
multi-area Frequency Control by using the combination of PSO and fuzzy logic
control (FLC) technique. PSO optimization method is used to tuning the fuzzy
controller input and output gains. Four of an interconnected electrical power
system used as a testing the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to a
conventional PI controller and scaled-fuzzy controller. The simulation result
has been shown that the controller can generate the best dynamic response in
multi-load conditions.

	As the ,existing coordinated control
strategies between grid and unit have limitations in isolated power system,
this paper introduces new coordinated control strategies which can improve the
stability of isolated system operation. This paper analyzes the power grid side
and unit side influence factors on the isolated power system. The dynamic models
which are suitable for islanding operation are applied to simulate and analyze
the stability and dynamic characteristics of the isolated power system under
the conditions of different load disturbances and governor parameters. ,With considering the differences of frequency characteristics
between the interconnected and isolated power system, the adjusting and
optimization methods of under frequency load shedding are proposed to meet the
frequency stability requirements simultaneously in the two cases. Not only
proper control strategies of the power plant but the settings of their parameters
are suggested to improve the operation stability of the isolated power system.
To confirm the correctness and effectiveness of the method mentioned above, the
isolated system operation test was conducted under the real power system
condition, and the results show that the proposed coordinated control
strategies can greatly improve stability of the isolated power system.

	The paper demonstrates the possibility to enhance the
damping of inter-area oscillations using Wide Area Measurement (WAM) based adaptive
supervisory controller (ASC) which considers the wide-area signal transmission
delays. The paper uses an LMI-based iterative nonlinear optimization algorithm
to establish a method of designing state-feedback controllers for power systems
with a time-varying delay. This method is based on the delay-dependent
stabilization conditions obtained by the improved free weighting matrix (IFWM)
approach. In the stabilization conditions, the upper bound of feedback signal’s
transmission delays is taken into consideration. Combining theoriesof state
feedback control and state observer, the ASC is designed and time-delay output
feedback robust controller is realized for power system. The ASC uses the input
information from Phase Measurement Units (PMUs) in the system and dispatches
supplementary control signals to the available local controllers. The design of
the ASC is explained in detail and its performance validated by time domain
simulations on a New England test power system (NETPS).

	,This paper presents an adaptive Under Frequency Load Shedding scheme based on Wide Area Measurement System. Due to the lack of
enough adaptability to the operation state of the system, the traditional
successive approximation under frequency load shedding method will cause excessive
cut or undercut problems inevitably. This method consists first in a
comprehensive weight index including load characteristics and inertias of generators.
Then active-power deficit calculation based on the Low-order Frequency Response
Model, concerning the effect of voltage was put forward. Finally, a dynamic
correction of the load shedding amount was proposed to modify the scheme. This
approach was applied to IEEE-39 system and the simulation results indicated
that the proposed method was effective in reducing the load shedding amount as
well as the frequency recovery time.

	In digital substations with power transformers, the key to implementation of line differential protection is synchronization of electrical
quantities at both two sides. System framework of current differential
protection for lines between digital substations is analyzed briefly, as well
as the necessity of demand for time synchronization. Principle of time synchronization
based on GPS and IEEE1588 PTP (Precision Time Protocol) are introduced. Time
synchronization of current differential protection between digital substations
based on IEC61850 is discussed. This paper puts forward two solution schemes of
time synchronization, analyzes their advantages and disadvantages respectively,
and points out that the development direction of time synchronization of differential
protection between digital substations is IEEE1588 PTP.

	Nowadays with the improvement in the degree of emphasis
on new energy, the wind power system has developed more and more rapidly over
the world. Usually the wind plants are located in the remote areas which are
far from the load centers. Generally series compensated AC transmission and
high voltage DC transmission are made use of to improve the transmission
capacity as two main effective ways which can solve the problem of large scale
wind power transmission. The paper describes the three kinds of impact varieties and
impact mechanisms in the sub-synchronous oscillation phenomena of wind power system
based on doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind generators. At last, we
point out the important problem that should be stressed in the wind power
system.

	In China, the unilateral power supply has been used in
AC electrified railway, which depends on the management mode of power system.
For better economic and technical indexes, all-parallel AT traction system is
widely used in passenger dedicated line. In this paper, the equivalent circuit
model of unilateral power supply and bilateral power supply is investigated,
and based on this model, the difference between unilateral power supply
impedance and bilateral power supply impedance is discussed.

	Clustering evolving data streams is
important to be performed in a limited time with a reasonable quality. The
existing micro clustering based methods do not consider the distribution of
data points inside the micro cluster. We propose LeaDen-Stream (Leader Density-based
clustering algorithm over evolving data Stream), a density-based
clustering algorithm using leader clustering. The algorithm is based on a
two-phase clustering. The online phase selects the proper mini-micro or
micro-cluster leaders based on the distribution of data points in the micro
clusters. Then, the leader centers are sent to the offline phase to form final
clusters. In LeaDen-Stream, by carefully choosing between two kinds of micro
leaders, we decrease time complexity of the clustering while maintaining the
cluster quality. A pruning strategy is also used to filter out real data from
noise by introducing dense and sparse mini-micro and micro-cluster leaders. Our
performance study over a number of real and synthetic data sets demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

	Considering units starting and network constraints and the
concept of optimization period,a optimization model which is a typical
multi-constraint knapsack problem is established to solve the selection
optimization problem of units starting in power system restoration period in
this paper, and the objective of the model is to maximize the total power generation
capability. A relative effectiveness assessment based on a improving data
envelopment analysis is adopted to select the initial units to be started, genetic
algorithms are employed to solve the knapsack problem to determine the most
reasonable units be started at the current time. Finally, IEEE-39 bus system simulation
result proves that the proposed model is feasible and effective.

	Owing to the effect of classified
models was different in ,Protein-Protein Interaction(PPI) extraction, which was made by
different single kernel functions, and only us,ing single kernel function
hardly trained the optimal classified model to extract PPI, this paper presents
a strategy to find the optimal kernel function from a kernel function set. The
strategy is that in the kernel function set which consists of
different single kernel functions, endlessly finding the last two kernel
functions on the performance in PPI extraction, using their optimal kernel
function to replace them, until there is only one kernel function and it’s the
final optimal kernel function. Finally, extracting PPI using the classified
model made by this kernel function. This paper conducted the PPI extraction
experiment on AIMed corpus, the experimental result shows that the optimal convex
combination kernel function this paper presents can effectively improve the
extraction performance than single kernel function, and it gets the best
precision which reaches 65.0 among the similar PPI extraction systems.
