					University libraries are currently facing their greatest challenge. For more than a decade, university libraries have been under the pressure to change its way of operation and management due to the tight of budget and the appearance of online resources. These situations cause the libraries to value their development of resources and the application of business marketing to better service. How to retain and grow users through enhancement of service becomes the great concern by library managers.  Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is not a tactical or functional approach but a key strategic process. A comprehensive CRM will highlight the preference and learning needs of readers individually for cost saving and enhance the retention and loyalty. We aim to propose an integrated conceptual framework implying with business marketing plan and CRM perspective through literature finding.

					As digital halftone images are widely used in the printing of books, magazines, newspapers and computer printers, the ease with which perfect copies can be made, may lead to large-scale unauthorized copying. Watermarking has been considered for many copy prevention and copyright protection applications. The hybrid watermarking system is proposed for halftone images that the watermarks embedded based on the spatial domain and frequency domain separately to enhance the robustness. For the purpose of copyright protection, the watermarks are embedded into the halftone image with visual transparency and robustness by the variety of dispersed dot order dither arrays generated by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method achieving good robustness and image quality produce patterns for the spatial watermarks embedding system.  After the binary pseudo-wavelet transform (BPWT), the second watermarks are embedded into the high-frequency components of the BPWT coefficients of the spatial domain based watermarked image that the frequency domain based watermarking is independent to the spatial domain based one. And the modified quality criterion system for halftone images is proposed by using the PSO based visual filter. The experimental results show that the hybrid watermarking algorithm is more robust for halftone images and the watermarked halftone image possesses high image quality by the PSO algorithm.

					An image can be considered as a fuzzy subset of plane. Fuzzy entropy measuring the blur in an image is a functional which increases when the sharpness of its argument image decreases. In this paper we consider three parameters such as the intensification parameter t, the fuzzifier h f and crossover point c  .The partially ordered set and lattice theory defined in section 2 strengthens the selection of any value in the interval [0, 1] such that the image can be enhanced. Here we verify the approximate value of c  and visual observation image enhancement in different figures. By entropy minimization technique we construct an approximation of the ideal image and for that we apply the enhancement operation to the low contrast image. This can be done by an optimization process that minimizes a criterion function.

					The current Internet protocol, version 4, known as IPv4, poses several problems such as impending exhaustion of its address space, configuration and complexities due to rapid growth of the Internet and emerging new technologies.  As a result, IETF developed the next generation IP, called IPv6, to not only eliminate the shortcomings of IPV4 but also deliver new features and services. Transition technologies were developed to support the transition from the IPv4-based Internet to IPv6-based Internet. This paper discusses the 6to4 mechanism, a powerful IPv6 transition tool that will allow both traditional IPv4-based Internet end-user sites and new IPv6- only Internet sites to utilize IPv6 and operate successfully over the existing IPv4-based Internet routing infrastructure. This paper also outlines the security issues brought about by the connectivity and interoperability of IPv6 to IPv4 domains particularly the 6to4 mechanisms.

					The usage of mobile network is significantly growing and it can be used in mobile platforms such as airplane, train, bus, car, etc. It is very useful for day-to-day activities of human beings. A mobile network can be connected to the Internet anywhere at anytime. But all these comforts depend on the technological aspects. The differences between the application demand and network performance are inevitable. These differences determine whether the Quality of Service (QoS) is met or not. There are different types of Internet applications and mobile network interfaces.  The Internet applications are file transfer, telephony, video conferencing, etc. The QoS requirements will vary from one application to another application. The mobile network interfaces are GPRS, IEEE 802.11x, WiMAX, etc. The data rates will vary from one interface to another interface. This paper aims to propose an intelligent technique which forwards data packets via suitable network interface. The outcome of this paper greatly improves QoS in multihomed mobile network.

					 The internet is used for wide variety of applications in wired, fixed wireless and mobile wireless environment. The requirements of one application / environment will vary from another application / environment.  The challenge for the service provider is Quality of Service (QoS). The wired network has less complexity compared to fixed wireless network with respect to QoS. Certainly, the challenge for the service provider is further increased in mobile wireless network. This paper proposes a QoS strategy to select an appropriate coding scheme for any application based on the characteristics of coding schemes and data rates provided by the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). This paper also analyzes coding schemes with various internet applications and QoS parameters like reliability, delay and bandwidth. The outcome of our strategy and analysis will help to select an appropriate coding scheme and to reduce the complexities involved in the data transfer with respect to the above parameters in wireless mobile networks.

					Security of computer systems and networks has become very significant nowadays. Introducing and using a unified framework for modeling and quantitative security evaluation (QSE) is an open problem. Th results of our study on drawbacks of the existing security assessment methodologies motivated us to use a simulation framework for model-based security evaluation. We have used discrete-event simulation (DES) and the SimEvents tool for QSE of a domain name system (DNS). First, the normal operation of the DNS is simulated. Then, an attacker is added to the model. The aim is to evaluate the instantaneous availability of DNS as an important measure of security. Finally, as a case study, DNS spoofing attack model is constructed and the availability of the attacked system is evaluated. The proposed approach can be used for other kinds of attacks and other types of systems, networks and applications. In this paper the simulation models and their results are presented.

					The problem of estimating a signal that is corrupted by additive noise has been of interest to many researchers for practical as well as theoretical reasons. Many of the traditional denoising methods have been using methods such as the Wiener filtering. Recently, nonlinear methods, especially those based on wavelets have become increasingly popular, due to a number of advantages over the linear methods. It has been shown that wavelet and multiwavelet thresholding guarantees better rate of convergence, despite its simplicity. This paper demonstrates the work of combining Parametric multiwavelet and Sureshrink to remove noise from the signal. Experimental results shows that the proposed work is 4% efficient in terms of SNR values and image quality when compared to other wavelet families

					 The properties and performance of DDR p+pnn+  Wurtzite Gallium Nitride (Wz-GaN) Impatt diodes at Terahertz (THz) frequencies has been investigated for optimum bias current density through modeling and simulation technique. A double iterative computer method based on drift-diffusion model has been used to study the DC and small signal admittance properties of the device. The bias current density is optimized with respect to maximum conversion efficiency and device negative resistance at both 0.3 and 0.5 THz frequencies. The simulation studies show that these devices are potential sources for generating high RF power. The DC-to-RF conversion efficiency of the device is found to be 12.3% and 11.4% at 0.3 THz and 0.5 THz at the optimum bias current density of 2 x 107 A/m2 and 1.8 x 108 A/m2 respectively. The design results presented in this paper will be useful to realize experimentally Wz-GaN IMPATTs for Terahertz frequencies.

					Network anomaly detection has been a hot topic in the past years. However, high false alarm rate, difficulties in obtaining exact clean data for the modeling of normal patterns and the deterioration of detection rate because of “unclean” training set always make it not as good as we expect. Therefore, we propose a novel data mining method for network anomaly detection in this paper. Experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 dataset demonstrate it can effectively detect anomalies with high true positives, low false positives as well as with high confidence than the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, even provided with not purely “clean” data (unclean data), the proposed method is still robust and effective.

And, an eight-step algorithm based on Circular Hough Transform and Quadrant Radius Histogram was given to calculate the 3D particle position. Experiments on real defocused particle images have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method for 3D particle position recovery, and the minimum Mean Absolute Error of depth is about 0.18 mm.

					Three types of rough equalities were introduced by Novotny and Pawlak ([1, 2, 3]), which take care of approximate equalities of sets. These sets may not be equal in the usual sense. These notions were generalized by Tripathy, Mitra and Ojha ([10]), who introduced the concepts of rough equivalences of sets. These approximate equalities of sets capture equality of the concerned sets at a higher level than their corresponding rough equalities. Some more properties were proved in [11]. In this paper, we introduce two other types of approximate equalities of sets, called the approximate rough equivalences and approximate rough equality. We study some properties of these four types of approximate equalities and analyse their relevance from the application point of view.

					Privacy is a pinnacle concern of the cloud database model known as “Database as a service (DaaS)”. DaaS is highly appreciated in business community because it saves hardware cost, cost of the technical people required to manage the database and it also saves the license cost of the database.  Moreover, it offers reliable services and people can access their data 24 x 7 from anywhere provided the internet connection is available. Despite of all these advantages enterprises are reluctant to adopt DaaS, because of two types of threats that are associated with it. Firstly, it can be attacked by the hacker and secondly the privacy of data can be compromised by the administrators, managing the cloud database environment. In this paper we have focused on the second issue and proposed a model to protect privacy of data stored in cloud databases. As per proposed model we encrypt and obfuscate data on client side before sending to the cloud database. In addition we offer mechanism to query over encrypted and obfuscated data on server side. Once the required data is filtered on server side, it is transferred on client side where the de-obfuscation and decryption is performed. Experiment results are also highlighted showing the enhancement in performance due to obfuscation factor.

					Surface roughness is an index which determines the quality of machined products and is influenced by the cutting parameters. In this study the average surface roughness Ra (value) for Aluminum after ball end milling operation has been measured. 84 experiments have been conducted varying cutter axis inclination angle (φ degree), spindle speed (S rpm), feed rate (fy mm/min), radial depth of cut (feed fx mm), axial depth of cut (t mm) in order to find Ra. This data has been divided into two sets on a random basis; 68 training data set and 16 testing data set. The training data set has been used to train different ANN and ANFIS models for Ra prediction. And testing data set has been used to validate the models. Better ANFIS model has been selected based on the minimum value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) which is constructed with three Gaussian membership functions (gaussmf) for each input variables and linear membership function for output. Similarly better ANN model has been selected based on the minimum value of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage of Error (MAPE). The Selected ANFIS model has been compared with theoretical equation output, ANN and Response Surface Methodology (RSM). This comparison is done based on RMSE and MAPE. The comparison shows that selected ANFIS model gives better result for training and testing data. So, this ANFIS model can be used further for predicting surface roughness of Aluminum for three dimensional end milling operation.

					Image deblurring refers to procedures that attempt to reduce the blur amount in a blurry image and grant the degraded image an overall sharpened appearance to obtain a clearer image. The point spread function (PSF) is one of the essential factors that needed to be calculated, since it will be employed with different types of deblurring algorithms. In this paper, the authors studied various fast deblurring techniques like Richardson – Lucy and its optimized version, Van Cittert and its enhanced version, Landweber, Poisson Map, and Laplacian sharpening filters. Furthermore, altered optimized versions of Landweber and Poisson Map algorithms have been presented. The usage of the PSF in the deblurring algorithm is explained and a comparison between the optimized, the enhanced algorithms and Laplacian sharpening filters in terms of the number of mathematical operations, number of iterations employed, computation time, deblurring in case of noise existence, and the accuracy measurement using peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) for each technique is conducted.

					As vehicular networks become popular and many vehicles want to access data through a roadside unit. In this paper, there was a vehicle to roadside communication and we propose scheduling schemes for efficient delivery of data packets in vehicular adhoc network. On the basis of priority scheduling algorithm vehicles can download/upload the data from RSU. In this paper we can control the congestion and delay of data by assigning the priorities to the message. The process with highest priority is executed first and highest priority is assign to those processes which have the smallest data size and this scheme is the smallest data size first scheduling(SDF) . If the two processes having the same data size then we can assign the priority on the basis of first come first serve scheduling (FCFS). We can combine these two algorithms and the new algorithm D*A. is introduced. This algorithm is responsible for only sending the commercial messages and the safety messages will be send on the different channel. The emergency messages will be sending through control channel with help of EDF scheduling. This paper increases the efficiency and throughput of the process and decreases the turnaround time for the process.

					Wireless sensor networks have emerged as a promising technology for a wide range of important applications. Energy conservation and prolonging the network lifetime are significant challenges in the design and implementation of wireless sensor networks. Clustering techniques have emerged as a popular choice for prolonging the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose a Two-Level Cluster based Protocol (TLCP) for wireless sensor networks to minimize the energy consumption and maximize the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. TLCP organizes sensor nodes into clusters and improves the data transmission mechanism from the cluster heads to the base station via constructing a cluster among the cluster heads. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol has better performance than LEACH and CBRP in terms of network lifetime, stability period, instability period, energy consumption and network throughput.

					Sorting is a commonly used operation in computer science. In addition to its main job, sorting is often required to facilitate some other operation such as searching, merging and normalization. There are many sorting algorithm that are being used in practical life as well as in computation. A sorting algorithm consists of comparison, swap, and assignment operations. Bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort are algorithms which are easy to comprehend but have the worst time complexity of O(n2). In this paper enhancement of the selection sort and the bubble sort by eliminating some useless comparisons is presented. A stack is used to store the locations of the past or local maximums, which can be used in later iterations of these algorithms. The insertion sort is improved by reducing shift operations with the aid of a double sized temporary array. The new algorithms are discussed, analyzed, tested and executed for benchmarking along with representing results. A significant improvement of well above 200% is achieved.

The mobile telephone has a considerable effect in tourism by allowing the user to access the contents from Internet or from an install application over the mobile devices. The existing tourist guide applications use the latest technologies to enhance the application quality by satisfying the user’s requirements. These applications encounter great challenges because of limited mobile resources. Several development platforms for mobile applications are used to design tourist guide applications a caused to mobile devices incompatibility.  Some of these applications are designed using, for example, J2ME which represents an effective language for small and portable devices. But, the ideal platform, now, for this type of applications is Android, it is designed to improve efficiency and reduce resource consumption compared to J2ME. The most used technology is Java programming languages but Android is more powerful, flexible and Android phones have more functionality than J2ME phones. In this paper, we build electronic tourist guide systems using the two technologies to confirm the powerful of Android. For this reason, a comparison between the two systems is made. The applications are tailored to user preferences, so that the user can access the application from a simple interface or automatically; the information may be displayed according to GPS positioning system. The system is built to be a tourist guide for Jordan, but it is flexible and easy to be for any country. To do that, the administrator need to know the GPS coordinates of each point of interest, and then the desired information may be added to database.

					Cognitive radio has been demonstrated for improved spectrum utilization by secondary users in the presence of spectrum holes. In this paper, a Cognitive Radio (CR) network is implemented over the cooperative multihop wireless link. A multihop network is a collection of relay nodes within transmitter and receiver. A fixed infrastructure based multihop architecture is assumed for the performance analysis of energy detection algorithm for spectrum sensing in CR.  System performance estimation against channel impairments dominated by fading and shadowing effects is one of the prerequisite for performance analysis of such networks. An effort has been made for exact performance analysis of multihop wireless network over composite fading channels. The investigation lead to the findings i.e., for a given value of fading or shadowing parameter, the preferable detection probability is always dependent upon the optimum number of hops. Depending upon SNR a three- or five- hop link may perform better. For severe fading conditions, the one-hop link performs best.

Dielectric Elastomers (DEs) are implemented into the model. That leads to higher reliability and user-friendliness, because the system contains fewer components. In addition, DEs have the desirable feature of being able to act similar to human muscles, and that makes their integration into human body easier than other technologies. An existing mathematical model of DE material is used to represent the bicep muscle. A set of operational parameters is selected in order to specify the design details.

					Influence of dielectric materials as gate oxide on various short channel device parameters using a 2-D device simulator has been studied in this paper. It is found that the use of high-k dielectrics directly on the silicon wafer would degrade the performance. This degradation is mainly due to the fringing field effect developed from gate to source/drain. This fringing field will further generate electric field into the channel region from source/drain region which weakens the gate control. Therefore, by taking the gate stack engineering into account it  has been  shown that the induced  electric field along the channel  can be minimized as well as the device performance can be enhanced.  This paper examined  various  parameters of the device like potential distribution from source and drain, threshold voltage (Vth), drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL), subthreshold slope (SS), on-current (Ion), off-current (Ioff) and Transconductance (gm) by taking different dielectric materials [SiO2(  =3.9), Si3N4 (  =7.5), HfO2 (  =24) and Ta2O5 (  =50) ] as gate oxide (s).

					Software is a complex entity composed in various modules with varied range of defect occurrence possibility. Efficient and timely prediction of defect occurrence in software allows software project managers to effectively utilize people, cost, time for better quality assurance. The presence of defects in a software leads to a poor quality software and also responsible for the failure of a software project. Sometime it is not possible to identify the defects and fixing them at the time of development and it is required to handle such defects any time whenever they are noticed by the team members. So it is important to predict defect-prone software modules prior to deployment of software project in order to plan better maintenance strategy. Early knowledge of defect prone software module can also help to make efficient process improvement plan within justified period of time and cost. This can further lead to better software release as well as high customer satisfaction subsequently. Accurate measurement and prediction of defect is a crucial issue in any software because it is an indirect measurement and is based on several metrics. Therefore, instead of considering all the metrics, it would be more appropriate to find out a suitable set of metrics which are relevant and significant for prediction of defects in any software modules. This paper proposes a feature selection based Linear Twin Support Vector Machine (LSTSVM) model to predict defect prone software modules. F-score, a feature selection technique, is used to determine the significant metrics set which are prominently affecting the defect prediction in a software modules. The efficiency of predictive model could be enhanced with reduced metrics set obtained after feature selection and further used to identify defective modules in a given set of inputs. This paper evaluates the performance of proposed model and compares it against other existing machine learning models. The experiment has been performed on four PROMISE software engineering repository datasets. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection based LSTSVM predictive model on the basis standard performance evaluation parameters.

					In order to reduce the loss in the circulation of agricultural products, and to reduce the total cost, this article minimizes the operation cost by establishing an objective function when designing the cold chain logistics distribution network. Considering the characteristics of the cold chain products, this paper regards construction cost of network nodes, transportation cost and damage cost as the main factors in establishing an objective function. As the cold chain logistics is correlated to the demand of service time, this article comes up with a concept of ""service radius"", which transformed the transportation time between logistics nodes into the service radius of logistic nodes. The model is verified through a series of constraint conditions to express the relationship between the various decision variables. An example is given in the end, which demonstrates the application of this model in a vegetable firm distribution logistics network planning. The final computation results illustrated that the model is effective.

					The newly discovered Th2 pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-17E belongs to the member of IL-17 family. In this study, bioactive recombinant mutated human IL–17E (rhIL–25) was synthesized using overlapping PCR strategy and amino acid mutations were carried out using site directed mutagenesis. Four cysteins at 78th, 83rd, 136th and 138th positions were involved in disulphide bond formation and were responsible for biological activity of mature protein. These four cysteins were replaced with serine using nucleotide substitution and the desired outcome was cloned into expression vector pRSET-A followed by expressed in a salt inducible Escherichia coli GJ1158. The transformants were selected by ampicillin resistance marker and also by DNA sequencing. SDS–PAGE analysis confirms 17.06 kDa purified protein against low molecular weight protein marker. Protein quantification was carried out using Lowry’s method. Approximately 104 mg/L of recombinant IL-17E was produced at 37 0C. Biological activity of protein was determined by the release of IL–6 from PBMC cells using rhIL–17E. This is the first report on production of interleukin-17E structural variant with enhanced specific activity without compromising the biological activity.

					This research aims at the designing and implementation of an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) with higher precision and hysteresis. AC power supplied by PDB (Power development board) in Bangladesh is subjected to variation from time to time. Moreover in rural areas supplied voltage remains lower than specified. This causes a considerable threat to the sophisticated electronic devices like computer, refrigerator, television etc. So ensuring the input voltage to remain in a tolerable pre-specified limit has become a necessity in rural as well as some urban areas. Current systems available locally lacks precision and suffers the problem of oscillating between  two output voltage and hence creating surge at the output which can damage valuable electronics. This research handled both shortcomings and introduced in the tolerable range of 215-237 volt using several taps. Hysteresis has been introduced while changing from one level to other and thus preventing oscillation.

					Profitability is the main goal of every software organization. Software companies develop products to capture greater market place and gain the attention of targeted customers or stakeholder. In the past the software engineering field was not able to determine the stakeholder’s value of the developing product as mostly systems were based on value neutral setting. With the emergence of Value based software engineering (VBSE) the traditional software engineering discipline is vastly changed as during product development the stakeholder’s value proposition plays an important part and the development is done accordingly. In this article I cover some important aspects of value based software engineering regarding their impact in software reusability and quality. Different value based pricing criteria are discussed. Empirical research and value based selection of best suitable automated tools and existing Component off the shelf (COTS) and conflicts between different stakeholders of the same system are also taken into account.

					Micro-EDM is a non-contact process based on the thermoelectric energy between a tool electrode and a workpiece. In µEDM process, the mechanism of material removal is melting and evaporation. The thermal energy in the discharge plasma helps remove material from the workpiece, at the same time deteriorates the quality and integrity of the workpiece surface. The material removal phenomenon in µEDM of partially conductive and non-conductive materials is very complex. This paper presents a novel approach to model the effects of electrical and non-electrical parameters on the material removal phenomenon and surface integrity for a non-conductive ceramic material. The fuzzy logic modeling system is employed for predicting the µEDM process responses. The trends in the material removal rate and hardness values with the chosen electrical and nonelectrical parameter for the model and obtained using AOM approach are compared. The average deviation between the model predictions and the results obtained using AOM plots is less than 10%. The material removal rate (MRR) decreases linearly with voltage, indicating a difference in material removal mechanism in the µEDM of non-conductive materials.

					Self-sufficiency in domestic palm oil supply remains unattainable in Nigeria, despite the various efforts of government to revive the subsector. The contribution of oil palm to employment and income in Nigeria is enormous. However, there is dominance of smallholders, low yield and inadequate documentation on productivity of the Oil Palm Production systems in the country. Thus, this study investigates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of oil palm production systems in Edo and Kogi States, Nigeria using Tornqvist TFP index. Data were collected by administration of structured questionnaires using multistage sampling procedures. The results showed that the oil palm production in the study area is structured into small (≤ 10 hectare (ha), medium (11 – 50 ha) and large (≥ 51 ha). The TFP of the large, medium and small scale OPPS were 1.04, 0.99 and 0.82, respectively, while the overall TFP was 0.92. The large scale system had the highest productivity, followed by medium scale system in palm oil production in the study areas. Therefore, Promotion incentives should be directed to large and medium scale systems with upgrading of small scale farmers to medium scale farmers.

					This paper proposes a novel secure query processing model for semantic sensor networks.

In brief, SSN is an extension of the current Sensor Network (SN) and realized by using Semantic Web (SW) technologies. Although various researches have been activated on SSN, there is little activity on how to access data in semantic sensor networks in safe. This paper proposes a new access control model for secure query processing under semantic sensor networks.

So problem is that a person has to take many cards and has to remember their passwords or secret codes and to keep secure to take with him all time. So the biometric payment system will solve this problem. Greater adoption of biometric payment system will drive down the cost of biometric readers and thus making it more affordable to small business owners. We really need alternate payment systems.

					In this paper, we study the localization problem in large-scale Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs). Unlike in the terrestrial positioning, the global positioning system (GPS) can not work efﬁciently underwater. The limited bandwidth, the severely impaired channel and the cost of underwater equipment all makes the localization problem very challenging. Most current localization schemes are not well suitable for deep underwater environment. We propose a hierarchical localization scheme to address the challenging problems. The new scheme mainly consists of four types of nodes, which are surface buoys, Detachable Elevator Transceivers (DETs), anchor nodes and ordinary nodes. Surface buoy is assumed to be equipped with GPS on the water surface. A DET is attached to a surface buoy and can rise and down to broadcast its position. The anchor nodes can compute their positions based on the position information from the DETs and the measurements of distance to the DETs. The hierarchical localization scheme is scalable, and can be used to make balances on the cost and localization accuracy. Initial simulation results show the advantages of our proposed scheme.

					Artificial K-lines (AKL) is a structure that can be used to store different types of knowledge, as long as this knowledge is represented by series of events connected by causality. Unlike, and, perhaps, complementary to, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), AKL can combine inter-domain knowledge and its knowledge base can be augmented dynamically without rebuilding of the entire system. In this paper we demonstrate the diversity of AKL by illustrating, through examples, its workings for three applications across three completely different areas of study.  The first example demonstrates that our structure can generate a solution where most other known technologies are either incapable of, or very complicated in doing so. The second example illustrates a novel, human-like, way of machine learning.  The third example presents a behavior metrics based method for password authentication.

					Multi-process bidirectional heuristic search algorithms (such as PBA*) that utilize island nodes have been shown to have the potential for exponential speedup over their plain counterparts that do not utilize island nodes. PBA* (Parallel Bidirectional A*) is a primary algorithm in this area and, to the best of our knowledge, unique in its usage of island nodes for reducing the size of the traversed search space and in its usage of multidimensional heuristics for reducing interprocess communication cost. Both, island nodes use and reference nodes use within the context of multidimensional heuristics have been reported to provide excellent performance, compared to plain heuristic search counterparts. However, both of these two features have also resisted refinements for over two decades. Specifically, the two main issues are: how to identify well-placed (in the state space) island nodes, and how to generate well-placed reference nodes. The work presented in this paper is an initial step toward this end. We present two methods, one employing Voronoi diagrams for the purpose of identifying well-placed island nodes, and one employing Kohonen Networks for the purpose of identifying well-placed reference nodes. We implement and compare our methods against a plain version of PBA*. Our finding indicate that the cost of incorporating the proposed improvements into PBA* is negligible; and when PBA* is equipped with the island identification method, or with the reference node identification method, it outperforms its random island nodes counterpart and its random reference nodes counterpart, respectively, for the vast majority of test cases.

					The interests of web users can be revealed by their visited web pages and time duration on these web pages during their surfing.

Internet, and in particular the World Wide Web, is becoming a learning space which is used increasingly in several educational contexts from secondary schools to post graduate courses. Learners can choose to take training modules and, in some cases, entire programs through the Net; the on line environment may be the only possibility to acquire knowledge on some topics for learners who do not have the opportunity to attend traditional classes; besides the communicative power of Internet tools can allow the activation of new ways of teaching/learning. As the number of on line learners is increasing, it is crucial for training centers and institutions to create effective on-line learning environments according to the specific needs of each learner. In fact, a lot of aspects have to be taken into account to project and activate a good distance course: effective presentation of contents, consideration of individual differences of users, adoption of several models according to educational objectives, and so on.

					 Patients with schizophrenia are known to be impaired in several areas of emotional processing, including psychophysiological reactivity. This study investigates the preliminary autonomic reactions and recognition of schizophrenic patients according to basic emotional conditions. The parameters such as electrodermal activity (Skin conductance response, skin conductance level), heart rat, and respiration were measured by using emotion evoked stimuli. We found out that there were no differences of accuracy for recognition with the target emotion between groups. Also, we found out that in anger (heart rate), fear (electrodermal activity, respiration), and sadness (heart rate, respiration) condition, there was a difference of physiological responses between groups.

					Textures are one of the important features in computer vision for many applications. In the literature, most of the attention has been focused on the texture features with minimal consideration of the noise models and window selection. To overcome this, in the present paper the features are constructed on preprocessed methods applied on the texture image by considering different types of windows. These features offer a better classification rate. The experimental results on various Brodatz textures clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

					This paper describes the innovative Learner Intelligent Feedback System (IFS) in terms of a set of three agent: Interface Agent (IFA), Information Agent(IMA), and Intelligence Agent(ILA). The agent can deduce the correct answers to test questions and provide intelligent feedback and hints to the learner. The intelligent feedback system is : Firstly, system presents content in initial learning style. Secondly, learner takes a diagnostic test. Thirdly, system analyzes user performance. Fourth, system identifies concept deficiencies and chooses the best learning model. Finally, system dynamically creates a remedial course tailored to the learner. The learner takes the remedial course, at the end of which is another test. If the learner still does not get the concept, he or she is returned to another dynamically generated course presented in a different learning style. At the same time the tutor agent notifies that one of her students is having trouble. The Tutoring agents are the driving engine of the system. Their main tasks are to generate appropriate learning feedbacks for learners and provide new learning problems and advanced situations. IFS can be used for complete course training, including test from a remote site.

					 Path finding is one of those required elements of the computer network. Any path finding algorithm will work as long as there are no obstacles or distractions along the way. If there is an obstacle, then the character needs to figure out a way to move around and still reach the goal.       In this paper, we have simulated the existing path-finding algorithms and state that A* is the most popular choice for path-finding and it is very flexible and can be used in a wide range of contexts
