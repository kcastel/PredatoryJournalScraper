		<div>Cloud computing provides the better resource sharing and utilization of services through virtual shared servers. The allocation and deallocation of resources effects on quality, processing, memory, and service provisioning. The automation of cloud computing services is a big issue till now This model provides the better utilization of resources on demand through an agent by using formal method technique Petri net. Petri net modeling is a straightforward description of the problem which is used to overcome this type of issues. The agent acts as a dealer and responsible to utilize the unused resources, automation of resources, and provisioning of all types of cloud services like IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and HaaS. This Petri net modeling facilitates the utilization of resources through an agent by using predefined procedures. Furthermore, it also provides the efficiency and cost effectiveness of cloud computing services.</div>

Each region can have one or more than one networks. Internet has become more influential tool to minimize the communication gap all over the world.  Internet service providers (ISPs) are providing cheap, fast and good communication services now a day. Today’s technology is playing important role in the growth of Internet users. The easy and cheap availability of computers, laptops, mobiles and Internet services may cause for Internet addiction. Internet addiction refers to extreme use of Internet which seems unmanageable in routine life matters, health, attitude, and relationships. Too much use of Internet affects the students spiritually, emotionally, morally and educationally. We have investigated the relationship between problems and measures of Internet addiction among 1000 university level students in the current study. Data was collected through questionnaires filled individually by every student. Results indicated that a large number of students waste their time on chatting and visiting useless sites. Moreover, interpersonal, academic and health problems were found. The reasons of positive and negative impacts of Internet addiction were also found. Survey showed that number of students was unaware to use the Internet properly.  It was observed that the male students were more Internet addicts than female students.<strong></strong></em></p></div>

Food consumed by an expectant mother is said to have an impact on the pregnancy outcome apart from other factors.</em> <em>For the past few years, perinatal mortality rate has been increasing in developing and under-developed parts of the world. Two-thirds of the world’s perinatal deaths occur in only 10 countries, and Pakistan is ranked third amongst these countries. These deaths have not been studied widely, in fact they have been under-reported and these reports have not even been considered in any attempts made to improve birth outcomes in developing nations [1]. Nutritional, socioeconomic, demographic and health advice seeking behavior factors are responsible for higher mortality rates in countries such as Pakistan. Data mining and machine learning can be used to identify factors that are responsible for such high infant mortality rates as it is an important factor indicating progress on Millennium Development Goals.

		<div>Offshore Software Development Outsourcing (OSDO) is increasingly becoming the normal practice in the software industry. It offers a bundle of core benefits for client organizations which includes: high quality, fast and cost effective development of software products. However, OSDO possesses substantial risks and limitations during project management. To handle such problems Portfolio Cost Management (PCM) is used one of the best approaches. It is a set of centralized management of processes, methods and technologies used between client and vendor to reduce software costs and improve quality. We have performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) by applying customized search strings obtained from our research questions, along with the other SLR steps such as protocol development, initial publication selection, final publication selection, publication quality assessment, data extraction process and data synthesis. In this research, we explore 16 success factors of PCM to analyze the association between a client and vendor. It includes: ‘efficient cost estimation strategies’, ‘efficient project management’, ‘efficient knowledge sharing management’, ‘efficient software effort estimation’, ‘planning realistic goals’, and nine others. Furthermore, we analyze these factors based on different types of organizations, i.e. research and non-research. For best results in the software industry, it is proposed for vendor organizations to address the factors: ‘efficient cost estimation strategies’, ‘efficient project management’, ‘efficient knowledge sharing management’, ‘efficient software effort estimation’ and ‘planning realistic goals’.</div>

		<div>In view of application in smart visual surveillance systems this paper presents a new method of object detection and tracking in a surveillance scenario. The paper proposes robust object detection and tracking mechanism in which the background subtraction uses parallel processed Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and the object tracking uses spatial color models of the detected object for tracking. The models of newly detected objects are stored in a reference list. Models of object detected in the next frame are compared with the reference models to track the object in the new frame. The spatial dimension introduced make the algorithm performs very well and fast. The system has been implemented both in indoor and outdoor environments and was found not only functionally okay but very computationally efficient in terms of processing time. The proposed system also is capable of detecting collision and object merging. One major areas the system contributes is the fast processing which is required by surveillance systems.</div>

Due to thin-skinned character of its data it desires to maintain confidential and magnify security challenge. Key association proposals have unusual interested in BSN because of small tiny nature and daily life usage of these electronic devices. The key role in safe and sound communication is key management practices. Confidentiality, authentication and integrity are achieved by applying key agreement and management methods. Accomplishment of key agreement in BSNs is very daunting task. In this paper we have presented a hybrid novel approach with rekeying for BSNs. Our scheme is based on symmetric and Elliptic curve cryptography. The existing key agreement schemes have lack of; security strength, scalability and some schemes take high computation cost and communication overhead. If only symmetric key scheme apply then scalability and security problems occur. And if only public key scheme apply then computation cost and key storage memory issues occur. Our proposed key agreement model is based on Elliptic curve and symmetric cryptography. We testify our results using NS 2.35. The proposed scheme reduces twenty seven to seventy four percent memory requirements for keys storage, fifty to eight four percent computation cost and twenty to sixty one percent communications overhead and also provides rekeying features.</div>

		<div>Occluded Red Blood Cells are observed frequently in the thin blood smear digital images. Separating the occluded Red Blood Cells from the single Red Blood Cells and further the splitting of occluded Red Blood Cells into single Red Blood Cells is a challenging job in the computer assisted diagnosis of blood for any disorder in many diseases like Complete Blood Count Test, Anemia, Leukemia and Malaria etc. The mentioned problem is also highly laborious in manual microscopy for the hematologist. Many techniques currently existed for the solution but suffered from both under and over splitting problems when highly complex occlusions of Red Blood Cells occurred. Also the existed techniques are not computationally efficient. In this, paper we address the mentioned problems in realistic, efficient and automated way by considering the boundaries of the occluded Red Blood Cells through convex hulls to divide the boundaries on the basis of distance calculation in a very simple and efficient way split the occlusions according to the number of Red Blood Cells. Further, we draw lines using Digital differential analyzer graphics line drawing algorithm at the two respective end points to give cuts to split the occluded Red Blood Cell. The test results of the proposed technique using standard online data set of thin blood smear digital images (provided by Centers of diseases Control and prevention, USA) are presented in this paper by qualitatively analysis through ground truth with visual inspection.</div>

This communication barrier seizes the basic right of communication between a deaf and a normal. Our contribution in this regard is actually two tiers. First, to the best of our knowledge, we have tried to combine all the efforts made for the development of PSL till date. Second, as a computer vision researcher, we have tried to analyze all the imaging systems developed to aid deaf to deaf and deaf to normal communication of PSL. We are hopeful that this effort will surely help to develop the systems for reducing gap between deaf to deaf, deaf to normal and Pakistan deaf to any other deaf communication.</em></div>

		<div><em>Wireless sensor network is widely used around us, which makes a great contribution to our daily life. In order to use such peculiar network well, security aspect should be taken into consideration, especially in some vital areas such as military field. Code image dissemination is one of the most important functions in wireless sensor network, so ensuring the security of this process is profound. Thus, in this paper, we first introduce the basic concepts of wireless sensor network and its security issue in code image dissemination. Threats and vulnerabilities of code image dissemination are pointed out to illustrate why attentions should be paid to this process. Then we describe the major code image dissemination protocols. These protocols are often used to disseminate code image in wireless sensor network, and they contain some common techniques. Thus, according to these features, we give the six most important techniques used in this area and illustrate how to use these methods to prevent the network from attacks. Moreover, we also give some open research issues in this direction, which could act as a guide for the latter scholars.</em></div>

		<div><em>Flow control, end-to-end (EED) delay, throughput, and energy consumptions are important factors of real-time and multimedia communication in mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET’s). It has a characteristic of the dynamic flow of data communication among the various users without using wired technologies. Due to this dynamic structure of MANNETS, most of its energy is consumed in route searching and packet retransmission. In addition, a problem of energy consumption may also occur due to network congestion and traffic flow control. In general, UDP is used for real-time communication but this protocol is unable to control the traffic flow properly. Therefore, a new protocol is developed for this purpose called datagram congestion control protocol (DCCP) used in those networks, which has an increasing number of multimedia traffic, and real-time flow. In this research work, major performance metrics with the issue of power usage of the TFRC and TCP like DCCP protocols are evaluated. </em></div>

		<div>Wireless sensor network  (WSN) is a network communication technology that is  characterized by its small size; low power consumption and limited memory capacity. It provides communication in a broadcast manner.  These sensor nodes have no specific infrastructure and they are placed randomly throughout the network.  The use of WSNs is to collect data from physical environment and in real time. Error in the collected data or malfunctioning of the sensors can create problems on large scale. There are few ways and methods through which WSNs can be attacked. One of them is the Denial of Service Attack (DoS), which captures the nodes and takes its important data, modifies it or halt it from responding to a bona fide user. Various techniques are used to tackle DoS attack on WSNS. By using the multiple base station approach we can reduce and minimize the drastic effect of DoS attack on WSNs and makes our network secure and functioning in its normal conditions</div>

However, the encryption and decryption of voice being transmitted over the GSM network still remains a question. In the domain of real time voice encryption, much of the work being carried out pertains to the voice being exchanged through the Internet Protocol. As compared to the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), voice over the GSM network has not seen much research work related to its security aspects. The purpose of this paper is to document the results of a project aimed at developing a platform for mobile phones in order to communicate over the GSM network in a secure manner. The most suitable method for achieving the above mentioned objective is to use an open source Operating System (OS), so that the source code is easily accessible and usable. In this paper, the Android OS will be under discussion, which is compatible with all the Android mobile phones. In this way, the maximum number of mobile phone users can be benefitted because Android cell phones are being widely used nowadays. The use of cryptographic algorithms for securing the voice communication over the GSM network is also a part of this paper. The work revolves around the Java programming language since the Android application development has been carried out in Java through the use of Android Studio. Also, NetBeans has been employed for developing algorithms for voice encryption. <strong>Keywords</strong>:</em> Android Operating System; Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM); encryption; decryption; cryptography.</div>

		<div><p><em>Requirement elicitation is the actual description of the system that the software developers follow in the earlier stages of development process. It is one of the most important and primary part in developing a new application or project. It describes what a system should do and what it is capable of doing. There are some essential requirements of a system that must be met for its correct functionality. Many software systems fail due to the wrong requirement elicitation practices or poor requirement elicitation. Without the help of elicitation, it is impossible to find out the needs and the requirements of the user. In Pakistan software industry, requirement elicitation practices are not followed. In this paper, we have analyzed the issues and challenges being faced by the Pakistan software industry due to the poor requirement elicitation process. The identified issues in requirement elicitation process include a change of scope, volatility problem, change in user needs, understanding problem, uncertain requirements, communication problem, and missing requirements.</em></p></div>

		<div><p><em>Knowing exact number of clusters in a digital image significantly facilitates in precisely clustering an image. This paper proposes a new technique for extracting exact number of clusters from grey scale images. It analyzes the contents of the input image and adaptively reserves one distinct cluster for one distinct grey value. The total count of the grey values found in an image determines the exact number of clusters. Based on the contents of image, this number of clusters keeps on changing from image to image. After obtaining this number, it is given as an input to Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) which clusters the image.GMM works with finite number of clusters and forms mixture of various spectral densities contained in that image. The proposed method facilitates GMM to adapt itself according to the changing number of clusters. Therefore, the proposed model along with the inclusion of GMM, is named as Adaptive Finite Gaussian Mixture Model (AFGMM).  The clustering performance of AFGMM is evaluated through Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). Both of these performance measuring methods confirmed that exact number of clusters is essentially important for reliably analyzing an image.</em></p><em><br></em></div>

		<div><p><em>Accurate feature detection during Image retrieval is important, data retrieves through image retrieval methods like CBIR and CBIR higher dimension data also need storage and access through different methods, content-based Image retrieval uses query like query by feature and query by example. More focus has made on accurate feature detection because need accurate feature retrieval. In simple words objectives are, to develop methods with sequence to classify features with normalization for efficient image retrieval from bulk dataset and also to improve method for local and global feature retrieval with automatic feature detection along accuracy.  After study of different detection-based system, a methodology has been proposed which improves retrieval based on feature detection and feature detection had been improve with combination DWT+PCA+KSVM (polygon kernel +RBF kernel + Linear Kernel).</em><strong><em></em></strong></p></div>
