		<div>Agriculture and industrialization has been generally accepted as the surest and most direct route to economic development of any country like Nigeria. Their potentials, if properly harnessed, has the capacity to grow a Nation income. In this paper, we investigated the impact of agriculture and industry on GDP in Nigeria. To achieve this, we employed the log transform data on Agriculture, industry and GDP from 1960 to 2011 extracted from the CBN website. The ADF test for stationarity was carried out for GDP, agriculture and industry, the result revealed stationarity of the series at 1% level of significance. Thereafter we model the time series using VAR and SVAR models. The results from the VAR model revealed that agriculture contributed about 58% to GDP while industry contributed about 32% to GDP in Nigeria. The study further revealed from the SVAR models that agriculture and industry contributed to the structural innovations of GDP in Nigeria but more contribution resulting from agriculture. The work therefore recommended that special incentive should be given to farmer and infrastructural facilities should be provided. While new approaches should be vigorously and honestly pursued by the Nigerian government in order to restore the glory of the industrial sector in Nigeria.</div>

		<div>For several decades, the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model and its variations have received much attention from researchers. Recently, there has been an investigation into an EOQ model incorporating effect of units lost due to deterioration in infinite planning horizon with crisp decision environment. Accounting for holding and ordering cost, as has traditionally been the case of modeling inventory systems in fuzzy environment are investigated which are not precisely known and defined on a bounded interval of real numbers. The question is how reliable are the EOQ models when items stocked deteriorate one time. This paper introduces Fuzzy Economic Order Quantity (FEOQ) model in which it assumes that units lost due to deterioration is included in the objective function to properly model the problem in finite planning horizon. The numerical analysis shows that an appropriate fuzzy policy can benefit the retailer and that is significant, especially for deteriorating items is shown to be superior to that of crisp decision making. A computational algorithm using LINGO 13.0 and MATLAB (R2009a) software are developed to find the optimal solution. Sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution is also studied and managerial insights are drawn which shows the influence of key model parameters.<br></div>

		<div>In this paper, we consider an impulsive stochastic model for an investment with production and saving profiles. The conditions for financial growth for the investment are investigated under impulsive action and results are obtained using the quantitative and Ep stability methods. The impulsive stochastic differential equation considered is assumed to be driven by a process with jump and non-linear gestation properties. One of the results established shows that, in the long run, it is impossible for a financial investment to grow or dominates the prescribed average financial investment but has a threshold value for which the investment cannot grow beyond. It is also established that an $E^{p}-$ stable investment vector can be found which allows financial growth but this vector must be constrained to be in a given invariant set:It is advisable for the saving and depreciation to satisfy certain growth rates for proper income and investment growths.<br></div>

		<div>In this paper the concept of fuzzy Non-Linear Programming Technique is applied to solve an economic order quantity (EOQ) model under restricted space. Since various types of uncertainties and imprecision are inherent in real inventory problems they are classically modeled using the approaches from the probability theory. However, there are uncertainties that cannot be appropriately treated by usual probabilistic models. The questions how to define inventory optimization tasks in such environment how to interpret optimal solutions arise. This paper allows the modification of the Single item EOQ model in presence of fuzzy decision making process where demand is related to the unit price and the setup cost varies with the quantity produced/Purchased. This paper considers the modification of objective function and storage area in the presence of imprecisely estimated parameters. The model is developed for the problem by employing different modeling approaches over an infinite planning horizon. It incorporates all concepts of a fuzzy arithmetic approach, the quantity ordered and the demand per unit compares both fuzzy non linear and other models. Investigation of the properties of an optimal solution allows developing an algorithm whose validity is illustrated through an example problem and ugh MATLAB (R2009a) version software, the two and three dimensional diagrams are represented to the application. Sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution is also studied with respect to changes in different parameter values and to draw managerial insights of the decision problem.<br></div>

The analytical solution by Laplace transform technique of partial differential equations is used to obtain the expressions for the velocity, temperature and concentration. It is interesting to note that during the course of computation, the transient solution at large time coincides with steady state solution derived separately and the diffusion-thermo effect creates an anomalous situation in temperature and velocity profiles for small Prandtl numbers. The study is restricted to only destructive reaction and non-conducting case cannot be derived as a particular case still it is quite interesting and more realistic than the earlier one.</div>

Due to the presence of three Banach spaces in the definition of retro Banach frames (or Banach frames) duality of frames in Banach spaces is not similar to frames for Hilbert spaces. In this paper we introduce the notion of Λ-type duality of retro Banach frames. This can be generalized to Banach frames in Banach spaces. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the dual of retro Banach frames are obtained. A special class of retro Banach frames which always admit a dual frame is discussed.</p></div>

C(T) is endowed with the strict topology (the topology generated by seminorms determined by continuous functions vanishing at in_nity). R. Giles ([13], p. 472, Theorem 4.6) proved in 1971 that the dual of C(T) can be identi_ed with the space of regular Borel measures on T. We prove this result for positive, additive set-valued maps with values in the space of convex weakly compact non-empty subsets of a Banach space and we deduce from this result the theorem of R. Giles ([13], theorem 4.6, p.473).</div>

		<div>The aim of this paper is to introduce and characterize some new class of functions in a fuzzy topological space termed as ps-ro fuzzy open(closed) functions, ps-ro fuzzy pre semiopen functions and ps-ro fuzzy semi-homeomorphism. The interrelation among these concepts and also their relations with the parallel existing concepts are established. It is also shown with the help of examples that these newly introduced concepts are independent of the well known existing allied concepts.</div>

		<div>In this paper, we apply the modified HPM suggested by Momani and al. [23] for solving the time-fractional Fisher's equation and we use the classical HPM to derive numerical solutions of the space-fractional Fisher's equation. We compared our solution with the exact solution. The results show that the HPM modified is an appropriate method for solving nonlinear fractional derivative equations.</div>

		<div>A subclass J_{p,\lambda}^{m,l}(\xi,\alpha) of p-valent analytic functions with a generalized multiplier transformation operator is introduced. We discuss the compactness as well as the extreme points of J_{p,\lambda}^{m,l}(\xi,\alpha) under the topology of uniform convergence. Finally, as one of the applications of extremal theorem, we solve the sharp distortion inequalities problem. Several related basic results and remarks about the old or new classes are also presented.</div>
